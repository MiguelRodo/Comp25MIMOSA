# README

The purpose of this project is to
`[briefly describe the project's goals and objectives]`

## Reproducing the analysis

Run the following code from the project working directory:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("projr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("remotes")
  }
  remotes::install_github("SATVILab/projr")
}
projr::projr_build_dev()
```

<!--
Change the above instructions, e.g. specify non-default parameters or
another approach entirely.
-->

## Directory Structure

This project follows a structured directory layout to organise input
materials, generated outputs, and temporary files efficiently:

- **`_reference/`**: Static documents that are not generated by analyses,
  such as assignment questions and reference materials.
- **`_raw_data/`**: Raw, unprocessed data files.
- **`docs/`**: Rendered documents produced from R Markdown (`Rmd`) or
  Quarto (`qmd`) scripts.
- **`_output/`**: Final analysis results, processed data, and exported
  reports.
- **`_tmp/`**: Temporary storage for cached outputs, intermediate
  results, and shared files.

## Links

- `[URLs to data sources (e.g. OneDrive), GitHub repos, etc.]`

## Details

`[Methods, timeline, team, data sources, software/tools, etc.]`
